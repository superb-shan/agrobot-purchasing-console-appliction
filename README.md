# Agrobot Purchasing Console Application

This is a mini-project done during the 3rd semester of College to strengthen our knowledge of DBMS & OOPS, made with following all the basic steps of creation of a software.

- We have used data from top agricultural robots purchasing sites.

- And used the concept of OOPs to access those data.

## Modules

- There are 2 modules in this application, those are:

> Customer Login\
> Company Login

### **Customer Login**:

In this new customers can create an user-id, or the existing customers can sign-in using their existing ids.

The creation of new users takes no delay, the database is instantly updated and the user is redirected to sign-in option.

Then the users can view the robots listed and opt to see the details of their choice.

### **Company Login**:

In this module, users cannot create a new user, this is to ensure the protection of data.

Only the main authority, like admin or the developer can give a new user id to a new user.

The signed-in user can view the data and also is allowed to manipulate the present data, which is also instantly reflected in the database.

> This application has no UI created and soley works on **Console**, as the scope of the project is to create a link between OOPS and DBMS.
> That surely has been established.

## Team

We are a team of two, [Theanesh](https://github.com/Theanesh-5) and [Myself](https://github.com/superb-shan), we did all the works unified, so that the outcome will be much greater than splitting the work, which gave us both th knowledge of all the parts of the project.
